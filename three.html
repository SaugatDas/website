The ancient city of Petra remained unknown until the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt discovered it in 1812.

The building called El Khazneh or the Treasury Chamber of Petra, was where the famous movie “Indiana Jones and the Robbers of the Lost Ark” was filmed.

Petra has been occupied by several civilizations since prehistoric times and has suffered many incursions by the tribes of Israel, Romans, and Ottomans.</p>
